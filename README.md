# Mobility trace data for San francisco dataset

The goal of this data science challenge is twofold:
1. To calculate the potential for yearly reduction on CO2 emissions, caused by the taxi cabs roaming without passengers. In your calculation please assume that the taxi cab fleet is changing at the rate of 10% per month (from combustion engine-powered vehicles to electric vehicles). Assume also that the average passenger vehicle emits about 404 grams of CO2 per mile.
2. To build a predictor for taxi drivers, predicting the next place a passenger will hail a cab.
Bonus question: 
3. Identify clusters of taxi cabs that you find being relevant for this assignment.
